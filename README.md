> Steps to Implement Sequencing Problem in Operating Research:

```
Import JAVA Module Files

Take input from keyboard i.e., Machines and Jobs

Take input m number of Jobs for n number of machines

Make n number of machines into 2 machines
    
    ->for i=0 to 
    
    ->for machine A add 1 to n-1 machines
    
               arr[0][i]
    
    ->for machine B add 2 to n machines

Now for
```
